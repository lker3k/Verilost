Individual modules are within the Modules folder, they can be run with the module_script.sh file, eg the rng module can be tested with rng_script.sh

To simulate the integrated modules, use the integration_script.sh in the Integration folder.

The Final folder does not contain test benches, it is the code that was running on hardware. This is because some changes we made after and was only run on hardware, without going back and testbenching
